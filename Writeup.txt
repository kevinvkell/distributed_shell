To test setup/tear-down time, I made a modified version of my client.
It is identical to the normal client except it only sets up the connection, authenticates, and exits.
This way, I can externally measure the time it takes to run only that portion of the client's tasks by running the test_client executable repeatedly in a shell script.
Since the other functionality has been removed, the time it takes to run the modified client should be very close to the actual setup/break-down time. 
I ran it ten times measuring the nanoseconds it took to complete. I took an average after all the runs.

To test throughput, I used the normal, unaltered client executable.
First, I use the client to execute a /dev/zero command that builds a file that is exactly 1MB on the server consisting of all null characters. 
Then, I run the cat command through the client ten times to get data on how long it takes to bring that data over from server to client.
Once complete, I take an average of the times and compute the throughput.
This method may not be the most accurate because it also includes the time it takes to authenticate. 
This can be offset by subtracting the setup/tear-down times gained in the first experiment from the times in this experiment.
This is not the best solution, but it provides a decent estimate.
